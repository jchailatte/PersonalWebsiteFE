ISSTH
Regardless of what I do, be it study or work, I will keep on living
Sometimes when you find certain things with certain qualities, it's just fate
I walk a different path than before but the direction is the same
Snow can only live in the winter. When it nears a fire, it dies. That is its life. It may yearn for summer, but, it can only desire it. In my hand, the snow becomes water, because this is not its world...
Don't search too hard for an answer. If you do, the answer you find might be false. At some point in your life, perhaps you will be able to find the answer. Don't give up.
Life is like a dream, like a leaf that no matter how beautiful, can only live for one season
Your path is winding and full of thorns and thistles, making it slow to traverse. Only with never-ending determination can you have the courage to face defeat and yet, proceed onward to reach your goal. Walk such a path and your path will be invincible. Fear not defeat. Fear giving up!
Now that is death... True death. To be erase from the memory of anyone you ever met as if you had never existed in the world.
The mountains have not a care yet, the snows whitens their hair; the water feels not the world's woe yet, its face wrinkles when wind blows.
Life is like a journey, filled with countless different experiences. Perhaps it is best to say that different experiences create different sceneries on that journey. If you experience bitterly cold wind, you will become snow. If you experience the blazing sun, then you become rainâ€¦.The type of life you experience determines what type of person you will be. That is what makes life wonderful
It's like the sages said, if you don't take a first step, you will never know which direction the road leads.
